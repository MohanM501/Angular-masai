In scripts => "start": "ng serve";
<ng-Content></ng-Content> is a directive;

To filter / select - It's not possible for nested child (when you are trying to filter from parent to child, if parent has nested child then those nested child are not be able to filter, but first level child can be filtered/selected )

# In TypeScript
  class abc{
    count:5 (by default it is a public property);
    public count:10 (this is also public property);
  }

  - Both binding works:- <app-child quantity={{count}}>  or <app-child [quantity]="count"> 

  - <app-child [quantity]="count">  with this  count:number=0 worked (number type worked in both parent and child) but didn't work with this <app-child quantity={{count}}> 

  - Content Projection:- sending the template from parent to child component; and you can acceess it using the directive called <ng-content>

  - this.childEvent.emit(); // here emit is dispatching event from child  to parent ;


  - folder (want to create a project without creating application);

  ng new folder --create-application=false

  // To generate new project inside the folder;

  cd folder

  ng g application communication --routing=false --style=css -t -s -S

    (-t -> I don't want to generate the template files
    -s -> I don't want to generate any external css files
    -S -> I don't want to generate any external testing files
    )
    
    - Multi-Projects time use ng new projectName
