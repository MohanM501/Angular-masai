 to change the default port;

 ## ng serve step-1-directives -o --port=5050

 ## <p *ngFor="let hero of avengers; index as idx">{{idx}}-{{hero}}</p>

 In the above p tag index can't be directly used inside the p tag ; you have to take it using "as" keyword ; because index is read only in angular; you can't use it.

 ## <ng-template ngFor let-hero [ngForOf]="avengers">
      {{hero}}
   </ng-template>

   (ng-template is used when you want to loop through without the help of elements we use ng-template);

   In output ; list of heros will be on one line; because these are not wrapped inside the elements;
   if you want ; then do inspect you can see only text not wrapped inside elements;

# Over loads css ; it shows only red; for below; it depends on order which is written first for this below condition;
- THis is called as casceding (overwrites)
<p [ngClass]="{redBox:rateing>1,blueBox:rateing>3}">Ng clllass</p>
.blueBox{
      width:20px;
       background-color:blue;
     }
     .redBox{
       width:20px;
       background-color:red;
     }
